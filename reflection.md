Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
  Vivian and Evelyn. I talked about what attributes I needed in the Conversatiom.java file, but both of us weren't sure at that time. I think nothing significant changed in my thinking because neither of us had a clear understanding of how to code this from the start. I got help from Vivian with making sure I forked and cloned the repository in the right way, which I was confused with.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
  I went to TA hour on Thursday over 8pm to get a quick check if I were going in a right way. Then I went to Jordan's office hour on Friday around 11:30am. I had a lengthy nested if-else statements to replace words, and I wasn't sure how to make it more concise while managing multiple replacements. He advised me to use 2D array and for loop, and I figured out!
- What are your initial impressions of Java?
  Although this isn't the first time working with Java, returning back from Python, I felt that Java is much more structured. Sometimes I find Java more easier as there's a clear, structured way in everything.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages?
  I think the underlying logic between Java and Python is quite similar like any other programming languages. Since we wrote python in an object-oriented style last time, working with Java didn't really feel different. The main difference I find between two languages is syntax, with java being more strict with punctuations. I think this gives me more frequent error.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
  I would say that overthinking before starting to code is not usually helpful, because many things become clearer while you're actually writing something down. As you can always edit the code later, it's better to just write anything and see how it works or get a feedback from other people. This aligns with the idea of "starting small!"
